# floater.nvim - Floating Terminal Tasker

This was a "Hello world" Vim plugin for me and I decided to use neovim's new-ish floating window support to create a floating terminal emulator. This coincidentaly also be used to spawn off background processes so it could also function as an async task runner.

# TODO
- Adjustable window sizes (currently only takes up half of the screen)
- Floating window positioning
- ???
